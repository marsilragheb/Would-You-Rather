 # Steps to run the project
 npm install

 The application allows the user to log out and log back in. The user should be logged in to submit new polling questions, vote, and view the leaderboard.
Once the user logs in, the home page is shown.
The answered and unanswered polls are both available at the root.
The user can alternate between viewing answered and unanswered polls.
The unanswered questions are shown by default.
The name of the logged in user is visible on the page.
The user can navigate to the leaderboard.
The user can navigate to the form that allows the user to create a new poll.
Each polling question resides in the correct category. For example, if a question hasn’t been answered by the current user, it in the “Unanswered” category.
